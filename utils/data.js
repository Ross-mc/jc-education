  "I have always had a passion for people and initially thought my place within the industry would be on a holistic treatment path. But after being sent to Creative Academy Manchester on a Brisa Gel Beginners course by my manager, I found a new love in the creation of stunning enhancements and a thirst for the knowledge. The encouragement and support I received throughout my training was overwhelming and inspiring .From there my love for CND grew and I continued on my journey to achieve my Brisa Gel Masters and then Grand Master status.",
  "I believe whole heartedly in the ethos of Sweet Squared of Love and Respect. I am incredibly proud to work with the brands that I love and trust - to guide others through their own journey, help ignite their passions and cheer-lead them in their own growth is a real blessing and privilege"
